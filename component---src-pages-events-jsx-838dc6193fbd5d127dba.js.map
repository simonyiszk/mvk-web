It uses\n\t * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\n\t * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\n\t * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\n\t *\n\t * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\n\t * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\n\t * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\n\t *\n\t * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\n\t * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\n\t * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n\t * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n\t * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n\t * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar Calendar = function (_React$Component) {\n\t  _inherits(Calendar, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t  function Calendar() {\n\t    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\t\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, Calendar);\n\t\n\t    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n\t      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args))), _this), _initialiseProps.call(_this), _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  Calendar.prototype.render = function render() {\n\t    var _props = this.props,\n\t        view = _props.view,\n\t        toolbar = _props.toolbar,\n\t        events = _props.events,\n\t        culture = _props.culture,\n\t        _props$components = _props.components,\n\t        components = _props$components === undefined ? {} : _props$components,\n\t        _props$formats = _props.formats,\n\t        formats = _props$formats === undefined ? {} : _props$formats,\n\t        _props$messages = _props.messages,\n\t        messages = _props$messages === undefined ? {} : _props$messages,\n\t        style = _props.style,\n\t        className = _props.className,\n\t        elementProps = _props.elementProps,\n\t        current = _props.date,\n\t        props = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['view', 'toolbar', 'events', 'culture', 'components', 'formats', 'messages', 'style', 'className', 'elementProps', 'date']);\n\t\n\t    formats = (0, _formats2.default)(formats);\n\t    messages = (0, _messages2.default)(messages);\n\t\n\t    var View = this.getView();\n\t    var names = viewNames(this.props.views);\n\t\n\t    var viewComponents = (0, _defaults2.default)(components[view] || {}, (0, _omit2.default)(components, names), {\n\t      eventWrapper: _EventWrapper2.default,\n\t      dayWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default,\n\t      dateCellWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    var CalToolbar = components.toolbar || _Toolbar2.default;\n\t    var label = View.title(current, { formats: formats, culture: culture });\n\t\n\t    return _react2.default.createElement(\n\t      'div',\n\t      _extends({}, elementProps, {\n\t        className: (0, _classnames2.default)('rbc-calendar', className, {\n\t          'rbc-rtl': props.rtl\n\t        }),\n\t        style: style\n\t      }),\n\t      toolbar && _react2.default.createElement(CalToolbar, {\n\t        date: current,\n\t        view: view,\n\t        views: names,\n\t        label: label,\n\t        onViewChange: this.handleViewChange,\n\t        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n\t        messages: messages\n\t      }),\n\t      _react2.default.createElement(View, _extends({\n\t        ref: 'view'\n\t      }, props, formats, {\n\t        messages: messages,\n\t        culture: culture,\n\t        formats: undefined,\n\t        events: events,\n\t        date: current,\n\t        components: viewComponents,\n\t        getDrilldownView: this.getDrilldownView,\n\t        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n\t        onDrillDown: this.handleDrillDown,\n\t        onSelectEvent: this.handleSelectEvent,\n\t        onDoubleClickEvent: this.handleDoubleClickEvent,\n\t        onSelectSlot: this.handleSelectSlot,\n\t        onShowMore: this._showMore\n\t      }))\n\t    );\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  return Calendar;\n\t}(_react2.default.Component);\n\t\n\tCalendar.propTypes = {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\n\t   */\n\t  elementProps: _propTypes2.default.object,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * The current date value of the calendar.

It uses\n * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\n *\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\n *\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will.
